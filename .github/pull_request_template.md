- [ ] I have run the code formatter with `./run_clang-format.sh` (see [README.md](README.md) for details)
- [ ] I have built the code in the Arduino IDE (or with the command-line tool) and pasted the build output below

**Arduino IDE build output:**  

YYYYMMDD-HHMMhrs (git hash <7+ char git hash>) (IDE ?.?.??) (board: Arduino Nano)

    Sketch uses 99999 bytes (99%) of program storage space. Maximum is 32256 bytes.
    Global variables use 9999 bytes (99%) of dynamic memory, leaving 9999 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.

<!--- Example:
20200420-0049hrs (git hash 493985f; branch fix_formatting) (IDE 1.8.12) (Arduino Nano) - PR #46: https://github.com/AmboVent-1690-108/AmboVent/pull/46

    Sketch uses 18176 bytes (56%) of program storage space. Maximum is 32256 bytes.
    Global variables use 1046 bytes (51%) of dynamic memory, leaving 1002 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.
