- [ ] I have run the code formatter with `./run_clang-format.sh` (see [README.md](README.md) for details on how)
- [ ] I have built the code in the Arduino IDE (or with the command-line tool) and pasted the build output below

**Arduino IDE build output:**  

<!-- YYYYMMDD-HHMMhrs is the date and time you ran the build command; ex: 20200420-0049hrs means 20
April 2020 at 0049 hrs (12:49AM--just after midnight). Also be sure to include at least the first 7
chars of your git hash for the commit you had checked out when you performed the build. Lastly,
specify your Arduino IDE version number and board. The board should be Nano unless you know
differently. -->
YYYYMMDD-HHMMhrs (git hash <7+ char git hash>) (IDE ?.?.??) (board: Arduino Nano)

    Sketch uses 99999 bytes (99%) of program storage space. Maximum is 32256 bytes.
    Global variables use 9999 bytes (99%) of dynamic memory, leaving 9999 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.

<!--- Example:
20200420-0049hrs (git hash 493985f; branch fix_formatting) (IDE 1.8.12) (Arduino Nano) - PR #46: https://github.com/AmboVent-1690-108/AmboVent/pull/46

    Sketch uses 18176 bytes (56%) of program storage space. Maximum is 32256 bytes.
    Global variables use 1046 bytes (51%) of dynamic memory, leaving 1002 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.
