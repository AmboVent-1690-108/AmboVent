20200422-0136hrs (git hash 222e6966211a877936bd2962692c0c57bd665e2f; branch more_incremental_improvements) (IDE 1.8.12) (Arduino Nano)  
Note: memory usage went up because we are now storing and printing the version number at startup.

    Sketch uses 18318 bytes (56%) of program storage space. Maximum is 32256 bytes.
    Global variables use 1074 bytes (52%) of dynamic memory, leaving 974 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.
